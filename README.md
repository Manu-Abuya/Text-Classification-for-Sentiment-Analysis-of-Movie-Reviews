# Text-Classification-for-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews

Project Description

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis of movie reviews using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) of a written movie review, which can be useful for understanding the general public's opinion of a movie and identifying specific aspects that viewers liked or disliked.

Project Tasks

    Data Collection: Gather a dataset of movie reviews by scraping websites such as IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes or using a publicly available dataset.
    Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the reviews to remove irrelevant information and standardize formatting by cleaning text, lowercasing words, removing       stop words, and stemming or lemmatizing remaining words.
    Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand distribution of sentiments and other relevant information, which is optional     but can inform later stages.
    Data Splitting: Split dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure model can generalize to new reviews.
    Model Selection: Select a machine learning model for sentiment analysis, such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, or neural network, or use     a pre-trained model from an NLP library.
    Model Training: Train selected model on training set and use validation set to select best model.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance of model on testing set to estimate ability to generalize to new reviews.
