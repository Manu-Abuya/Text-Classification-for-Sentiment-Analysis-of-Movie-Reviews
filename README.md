# Text-Classification-for-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews

## Project Description
Sentiment analysis of movie reviews is the process of using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) of a written movie review. This can be useful for understanding the general public's opinion of a movie, as well as for identifying specific aspects of the movie that viewers liked or disliked. 

#### Project tasks
Steps performed to complete the task:
  1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of movie reviews. This can be done by scraping reviews from websites such as IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes, or by using a      publicly available dataset of movie reviews.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the reviews to remove any irrelevant information and to standardize the formatting. This step may include cleaning the      text by removing punctuation, lowercasing all the words, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatizing the remaining words.
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset to understand the distribution of sentiments and other relevant                information, this is an optional step but can be useful to validate the data and can also inform later stages
  4. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. This is to ensure that the model will be able to generalize to new,          unseen reviews.
  5. Model Selection: Select a machine learning model for sentiment analysis, such as a logistic regression, a Naive Bayes classifier, or a neural network.      Alternatively, use a pre-trained model from one of the available NLP libraries.
  6. Model Training: Train the selected model on the training set and use the validation set to select the best model among different variants.
  7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set. This will provide an estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new      reviews.
